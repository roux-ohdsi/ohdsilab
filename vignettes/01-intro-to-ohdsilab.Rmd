The goals of the ohdsilab R package are two fold: (1) To streamline working with
the OHDSI-Lab data at the Roux Institute (and other OMOP CDM databases) and (2)
To provde an easier onramp for students and researchers new to working with the OMOP CDM or SQL 
databases. To do this, the package contains functions and template code snippets to facilitate easier use
of the Ohdsilab. These functions and snippits build on existing OHDSI R packages like
{DatabaseConnector} as well as standard R packages like {dplyr} and {tidyr}. The package also contains
a number of vingettes intended for R users who are new to OHDSI-Lab, the OMOP CDM, or working with 
data in SQL databases from R. 

## Installation

***For OHDSI-Lab users, we strongly recommend using the {renv} R package to install ohdsilab and
all other packages on your OHDSI-Lab Box/Workspace. Installation without {renv} is likely to fail
due to permission restrictions. A guide to using {renv} is here: https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html.***

Installation only needs to be done once, unless you are updating the package. 

```{r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("roux-ohdsi/ohdsilab")
```

or with {renv}:

```{r}
renv::install("roux-ohdsi/ohdsilab")
```

If you want to also install OHDSI packages (e.g., DatabaseConnector), set dependencies = "Suggests". This is recommended unless you are working on the AllofUs Researcher workbench as these packages take a while to install and are not terribly useful with the AllofUs database setup. 

```{r}
# using {remotes}
remotes::install_github("roux-ohdsi/ohdsilab", dependencies = "Suggests")
```

## Load the ohdsilab package

```{r setup}
library(ohdsilab)
library(tidyverse)
library(DatabaseConnector)
library(keyring)
```

*`library(ohdsilab)` should also load {DatabaseConnector}, {keyring}, and other dependencies,
but you might want to explicitly load them for transparency.*

## Snippets

{ohdsilab} stores some basic [snippets](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio_snippets.html) for quick starting new scripts and projects. Follow the instructions in the link above to install
the snippets. They are located in the /snippets folder in the package. The easiest way to copy
them is copy text below the first line from the raw file on github: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roux-ohdsi/ohdsilab/main/snippets/snippets. If you notice any
mistakes or have any suggestions for the snippets, feel free to create a pull request or 
start an issue on the github page. The snippet you'll find most useful to begin with is
probably ohdsi_new_script.

<!-- ## Functions -->

<!-- These are in development and being updated frequently.  -->


<!-- - `dbi_collect()` is a different version of the `collect()` function that uses DBI instead of dbplyr. There are -->
<!-- occasional errors with the `collect()` function where not all rows of the query are returned because the query -->
<!-- times out. In these cases, use the `dbi_collect()` function.  -->
<!-- - `rb()` is a function to "ROLLBACK" in redshift SQL. This is necessary when there is a mistake in the dbplyr generated -->
<!-- SQL code. You can use `rb()` instead of disconnecting and reconnecting to the database. -->
<!-- - `insertTable_chunks()` writes a table to your user schema in chunks to reduce writing time. -->

<!-- - `omop_join()` is a shortcut for a join from an existing query (e.g., a dplyr pipe chunk) to an omop table without -->
<!-- having to reference the connection and schema.  -->

<!-- - `icd2omop()` and `icd2omop2()` map a dataframe or vector of icd 9 or 10 codes to OMOP concept codes -->
<!-- - `cpt2omop()` maps a vector of cpt codes to omop concept codes. It can be used for any standardized vocabulary, -->
<!-- not just CPT4. (ICD9/10 are not considered standardized) -->
<!-- - `str_insert()` and `icd_periods()` help to insert periods into icd codes when they come without. This -->
<!-- is typically a necessary step before mapping to OMOP codes.  -->

<!-- - `aou_connect()`, `aou_ls()`, `aou_retrieve_from_bucket()`, and `aou_save_to_bucket()` are useful for -->
<!-- streamlining common code in the AllofUs workbench. -->
<!-- - `bookstore()` checks to see if packages are installed before loading them via `library()`. This is experimental -->
<!-- and could be used in place of `install.packages()` + `library()`.  -->

## Connecting to a database

If this is the first time connecting on your computer (i.e., your virual machine using the Amazon Workspaces), you'll need to set your credientials before
it will work. The snippet ohdsi_creds will create that code for you. When you
run each line, it'll generate a pop up where you can enter your database/ohdsilab
username (something like usr999) and your password (which is in your email). After
setting the credentials, you shouldn't have to do it again. 

```{r}
# Credentials
keyring::key_set("lab_user", prompt = "Username for this workspace")
keyring::key_set("lab_password", prompt = "Password for this workspace")
```

The following code was generated using the ohdsi_new_script snippet. It creates
a template for the basic code needed to connect to the database. Now that you've 
set up your credentials, see if it'll run without errors. Note that you'll also 
need to be using RStudio within the Amazon workspace box or you need to use the 
global connect VPN. 

```{r}
# ==============================================================================
# Packages =====================================================================
library(keyring)
library(DatabaseConnector)
library(tidyverse)
library(ohdsilab)

# Credentials ==================================================================
usr = keyring::key_get("lab_user")
pw  = keyring::key_get("lab_password")

# DB Connections ===============================================================
atlas_url = "https://atlas.roux-ohdsi-prod.aws.northeastern.edu/WebAPI"
cdm_schema = "omop_cdm_53_pmtx_202203"
write_schema = paste0("work_", keyring::key_get("lab_user"))
# Create the connection
con =  DatabaseConnector::connect(
  dbms = "redshift",
  server = "ohdsi-lab-redshift-cluster-prod.clsyktjhufn7.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com/ohdsi_lab",
  port = 5439,
  user = keyring::key_get("lab_user"),
  password = keyring::key_get("lab_password")
)
class(con)
# make it easier for some r functions to find the database
options(con.default.value = con)
options(schema.default.value = cdm_schema)

# End Setup ====================================================================
# ==============================================================================
```

## Querying the database

The ohdsilab pharmetrics database uses amazon redshift SQL and the OMOP CDM version 5.3. 

You can see information in the 5.3 OMOP version here: https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm53.html. The
database organization looks like this (this is a very similar OMOP CDM 5.4 - there are only very minor differences).

<img src="https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/images/cdm54.png"  width="100%">

A more comprehensive diagram with information about the columns in each of the tables
can be found here: http://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm54erd.html

The data help in the database is stored under the cdm schema You can think of a
schema as kind of like a subfolder in the database. So the pharmetrics data is stored
in ohdsilab/omop_cdm_53_pmtx_202203/... where the ... indicates what table you're interested in. 

To query a table in pharmetrics you might write a line of code like this:

```{r}
dplyr::tbl(
    con,
    DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema("omop_cdm_53_pmtx_202203", "concept")
  )
```

This code is looking for the concept table in the pharmetrics schema which is in 
the ohdsilab database. You can also see the concept table in the orange box
labelled "Standardized Vocabularies" in the picture above. 

You also have your own schema (sometimes called your "scratchpad")
where you can save information pertinent to your studies.
If you were usr999, you could access a table (that you have previously created) like this:

```{r}
  dplyr::tbl(
      con,
      DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema("usr999", "myCohort")
    )
```

Because these tables are in the database, we can connect them together. For example, 
you might use {cohortGenerator} to generate a cohort table in your schema ("myCohort"). Your
cohort table includes a column of person_id's (and some other information) that you
can use to reduce the giant amount of data in pharmetrics - usually with an `inner_join`. 

(See https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortGenerator/articles/GeneratingCohorts.html for a tutorial)

```{r}
dplyr::tbl(
    con,
    DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema("usr999", "myCohort")
  ) |> 
  dplyr::inner_join(
    tbl(
      con,
      DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema("omop_cdm_53_pmtx_202203", "person")
    ),
    by = "person_id"
  )
```

Remembering the name of the database schema and your usr schema can be a bit annoying. That's
why the ohdsi_new_script snipped also includes the following lines of code, so you can just
reference these strings using the variables `cdm_schema` and `write_schema`. 

```{r}
cdm_schema = "omop_cdm_53_pmtx_202203"
write_schema = paste0("work_", keyring::key_get("lab_user"))
```

It might look like this: 

```{r}
dplyr::tbl(
    con,
    DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema(write_schema, "myCohort")
  ) |> 
  dplyr::inner_join(
    tbl(
      con,
      DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema(cdm_schema, "person")
    ),
    by = "person_id"
  )
```

This can still be quite a bit of code for each join. Additionally, there are some known
bugs with using the dplyr *_join functions with our redshift database isntances. For these reasons, 
we recommend that you use the `ohdsilab::omop_join()` function can help streamline your code. 
It's a wrapper for the dplyr `join` functions that also includes some workarounds for a few known
bugs in the backround so that you don't have to worry about them as much. 

```{r}
dplyr::tbl(
    con,
    DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema(write_schema, "myCohort")
  ) |>
  ohdsilab::omop_join("person", type = "inner", by = "person_id")
```

It works because we set the default connection and cdm_schema using these lines of code from the
ohdsi_new_script snippet. The `omop_join()` function will look for these defaults first, 
and if it doesn't find them (because you didn't run these two lines), will let you know you need to provide them directly. Note that if you want to point omop_join() to your user scratchpad, you only
need to set `schema = write_schema`.

```{r}
options(con.default.value = con)
options(schema.default.value = cdm_schema)
```

Here's a toy example of how we can put all this information together. We can extract
all conditions for women born in 2002. Try to run these chunks to make sure everything is working. 

```{r}
# Start with a pointer to a table in the database. It could be in the cdm_schema
# or in your user write_schema.
female_2002 <- tbl(con, inDatabaseSchema(cdm_schema, "person")) |> 
	# filter the data for women born in 2002
	filter(year_of_birth == 2002, gender_source_value == "F") |> 
	# select only the necessary columns
	select(person_id) |> 
	# join to the condition occurrence table using an inner join
	omop_join("condition_occurrence", type = "inner", by = "person_id")

```

```{r}
# run to see a preview of the top 10 rows
female_2002
```

```{r}
# how many rows are in our data?
tally(female_2002)
```

If you get an error from the database, you often will need to "rollback" before running a new command. The error that tells you that you need to "rollback" usually looks like this: 

```
Error in `db_query_fields.DBIConnection()`:
! Can't query fields.
Caused by error in `.createErrorReport()`:
! Error executing SQL:
com.amazon.redshift.util.RedshiftException: ERROR: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
An error report has been created at .../errorReportSql.txt
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.
```

A rollback is essentially like going back in time to a world before you ran the chunk of code that caused an error. You can easily do this using ohdsilab provided you've set the connection and schema default values above. 

```{r}
rb()
```

This is synonymous with running.

```{r}
executeSql(con, "ROLLBACK;")
```
