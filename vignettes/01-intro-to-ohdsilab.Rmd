## Introduction

As a first step for using ohdsilab in R, please work through the code in this 
vignette line by line. It will give you some familiarity with the setup process 
and querying the data. It also includes important tips on using R and ohdsilab, 
which might differ from a typical workflow for using R. You'll want to have  the 
email you received when you first created your box handy, as it has your 
credentials in it.

## Starting a new project

Once you've created your workspace (i.e., your virtual computer) from the 
ohdsilab dashboard, and logged into your computer on the Amazon Workspaces App, 
you're ready to get started using R to query the database.

**R Projects and {renv}**

There are two important (maybe even necessary) steps for using R in the OHDSI 
Lab. The first is to use a project-oriented workflow. If you're new to 
R-projects and a project-oriented workflow, go read [this article](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/). You can 
find more details about projects here: 
https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html. The second is to use {renv} to 
manage package versions within your R projects. This R package, setup guide and 
the other vignettes assume that you are using these two steps. 

</div>



After opening RStudio, begin by going to `File` and select `New Project`. 
Give the project a name and select in your preferred location using the `browse` 
button. Make sure to check the box that says `Use renv with this project`. No 
problem if you accidentally skip this step, you can still activate {renv} by 
running `renv::activate()` as the first thing you do in your new project.

## Installing Packages

***We strongly recommend using the {renv} R package to install ohdsilab and all 
other packages on your OHDSI-Lab Box/Workspace. Installing packages without 
{renv} is likely to fail due to permission restrictions.*** 

A guide to using {renv} is here: 
https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html.

The first thing you should do is update renv. To do this, run the following code
in your console. 

```{r}
renv::upgrade()
```

Then, you can install the ohdsilab package from Github like this: 

```{r}
renv::install("roux-ohdsi/ohdsilab")
```

If you want to also install OHDSI packages (e.g., DatabaseConnector), set 
dependencies = "Suggests". This is recommended unless you are working on the 
AllofUs Researcher workbench as these packages take a while to install and are 
not terribly useful with the AllofUs database setup. 

```{r}
renv::install("roux-ohdsi/ohdsilab", dependencies = "Suggests")
```

You can also install and update regular packages from CRAN:

```{r}
renv::install("dplyr")
```

You may notice that trying to install packages without using {renv} results in 
errors that indicate that you don't have permission to install R packages. This 
is not the case - you are free to install R packages on your virtual 
computer/workspace - but you should use {renv} to do is. 

## Load the ohdsilab package

```{r setup}
library(ohdsilab)
library(tidyverse)
library(DatabaseConnector)
library(keyring)
```

*`library(ohdsilab)` should also load {DatabaseConnector}, {keyring}, and other 
dependencies, but you might want to explicitly load them for transparency.*

## Setting up your credentials

There are two sets of credentials you'll want to set up to make accessing the 
data and ATLAS easier. These credentials are in an email you received when you 
first created your workspace. 

First, set your credentials for the amazon redshift database (db). These 
credentials can be found in the email you received when you first launched the 
workspace next to "Amazon Redshift Username:" and "Amazon Redshift Password:" 
respectively.

```{r}
keyring::key_set("db_username")
keyring::key_set("db_password")
```

You can call these variables anything you'd like. They save your username and 
password in the background so that you can access your username and password 
quickly. For example, try running the following after setting up your username. 

```{r}
keyring::key_get("db_username")
```

You should also set up your ATLAS credentials, as they may be different than 
your redshift database credentials. These credentials can also be found in the 
email you received when you first launchedyour workspace next to 
"ATLAS Username:" and "ATLAS Password:" respectively.

```{r}
keyring::key_set("atlas_username")
keyring::key_set("atlas_password")
```

## Connecting to a database

You'll use the {DatabaseConnector} package to connect to the database. You will 
also need to download the Amazon Redshift JDBC driver. To do so, complete the 
following steps within your OHDSI Lab Workstation:

- Navigate to the [Amazon Redshift JDBC download page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/jdbc20-download-driver.html).
- Click "JDBC 4.2–compatible driver version 2.1 and AWS SDK driver–dependent 
libraries" to start the download.
- Move the JDBC zip file to a directory of your choosing.
- Right-click on the zip file, and select "Extract" to unzip it.

```{r}
# Schema Information ===========================================================
cdm_schema = "omop_cdm_53_pmtx_202203"
write_schema = paste0("work_", keyring::key_get("db_username"))

# Set the path to the JDBC driver you installed above
Sys.setenv("DATABASECONNECTOR_JAR_FOLDER" = "insert path to jdbc driver here")

# Create the connection
con =  DatabaseConnector::connect(
  dbms = "redshift",
  server = "ohdsi-lab-redshift-cluster-prod.clsyktjhufn7.us-east-1.redshift.amazonaws.com/ohdsi_lab",
  port = 5439,
  user = keyring::key_get("db_username"),
  password = keyring::key_get("db_password"))

# Test if the connection words
if(isTRUE(DatabaseConnector::dbIsValid(con))){print("Connected Successfully")}

# make it easier for some r functions to find the database
options(con.default.value = con)
options(schema.default.value = cdm_schema)
options(write_schema.default.value = write_schema)
```

Instead of including this at the top of your script, you can also use a shortcut 
function in from the ohdsilab package, which will do the same thing.

```{r}
con <- ohdsilab::ohdsilab_connect(
	username = key_get("db_username"),
	password = key_get("db_password")
)
```

## Querying the database

The ohdsilab pharmetrics database uses amazon redshift SQL and the OMOP CDM 
version 5.3. 

You can see information in the 5.3 OMOP version here: 
https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/cdm53.html. The database organization 
looks like this (this is a very similar OMOP CDM 5.4 - there are only very minor 
differences).

<img src="https://ohdsi.github.io/CommonDataModel/images/cdm54.png"  width="100%">

A more comprehensive diagram with information about the columns in each of the 
tables can be found here: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/dc75ba24-cbb6-4152-9528-a1f67b4b3843/view?page=0_0&invitationId=inv_d9040d51-a9b0-4d91-b3e5-f2f0ce927cf7#

The data help in the database is stored under the cdm schema You can think of a
schema as kind of like a subfolder in the database. So the pharmetrics data is 
stored in ohdsilab/omop_cdm_53_pmtx_202203/... where the ... indicates what 
table you're interested in. 

To query a table in pharmetrics you might write a line of code like this:

```{r}
dplyr::tbl(
    con,
    DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema("omop_cdm_53_pmtx_202203", "concept")
  )
```

This code is looking for the concept table in the pharmetrics schema which is in 
the ohdsilab database. You can also see the concept table in the orange box 
labelled "Standardized Vocabularies" in the picture above. 

You also have your own schema (sometimes called your "scratchpad") where you can 
save information pertinent to your studies. If you were usr999, you could access 
a table (that you have previously created) like this:

```{r}
# note - this wont actually work! the table doesn't exist
  dplyr::tbl(
      con,
      DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema("usr999", "myCohort")
    )
```

Because both of these tables are in the database, we can connect them together. 
For example, you might use {cohortGenerator} to generate a cohort table in your 
schema ("myCohort"). Your cohort table includes a column of person_id's (and 
some other information) that you can use to reduce the giant amount of data in 
pharmetrics - usually with an `inner_join`. 

(See https://ohdsi.github.io/CohortGenerator/articles/GeneratingCohorts.html for 
a tutorial)

```{r}
dplyr::tbl(
    con,
    DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema("usr999", "myCohort")
  ) |> 
  dplyr::inner_join(
    tbl(
      con,
      DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema("omop_cdm_53_pmtx_202203", "person")
    ),
    by = "person_id"
  )
```

Remembering the name of the database schema and your usr schema can be a bit 
annoying. That's why you should get in the habit of saving the schema names as 
variables at the top of your scripts, so you can just reference these strings 
using the variables `cdm_schema` and `write_schema`. 

```{r}
cdm_schema = "omop_cdm_53_pmtx_202203"
write_schema = paste0("work_", keyring::key_get("db_username"))
```

It might look like this: 

```{r}
dplyr::tbl(
    con,
    DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema(write_schema, "myCohort")
  ) |> 
  dplyr::inner_join(
    tbl(
      con,
      DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema(cdm_schema, "person")
    ),
    by = "person_id"
  )
```

This can still be quite a bit of code for each join. Additionally, there are 
some known bugs with using the dplyr *_join functions with our redshift database 
isntances. For these reasons, we recommend that you use the `ohdsilab::omop_join()` function can help streamline your code. It's a wrapper for the dplyr `join` functions that also includes some 
workarounds for a few known bugs in the backround so that you don't have to 
worry about them as much. 

```{r}
dplyr::tbl(
    con,
    DatabaseConnector::inDatabaseSchema(write_schema, "myCohort")
  ) |>
  ohdsilab::omop_join("person", type = "inner", by = "person_id")
```

It works because we set the default connection and cdm_schema using these lines 
of code from the ohdsi_new_script snippet. The `omop_join()` function will look 
for these defaults first, and if it doesn't find them (because you didn't run 
these two lines), will let you know you need to provide them directly. Note that 
if you want to point omop_join() to your user scratchpad, you only need to set 
`schema = write_schema`.

```{r}
options(con.default.value = con)
options(schema.default.value = cdm_schema)
```

Here's a toy example of how we can put all this information together. We can 
extract all conditions for women born in 2002. Try to run these chunks to make 
sure everything is working. 

```{r}
# Start with a pointer to a table in the database. It could be in the cdm_schema
# or in your user write_schema.
female_2002 <- tbl(con, inDatabaseSchema(cdm_schema, "person")) |> 
	# filter the data for women born in 2002
	filter(year_of_birth == 2002, gender_source_value == "F") |> 
	# select only the necessary columns
	select(person_id) |> 
	# join to the condition occurrence table using an inner join
	omop_join("condition_occurrence", type = "inner", by = "person_id")

```

```{r}
# run to see a preview of the top 10 rows
female_2002
```

```{r}
# how many rows are in our data?
tally(female_2002)
```

If you get an error from the database, you often will need to "rollback" before 
running a new command. The error that tells you that you need to "rollback" 
usually looks like this: 

```
Error in `db_query_fields.DBIConnection()`:
! Can't query fields.
Caused by error in `.createErrorReport()`:
! Error executing SQL:
com.amazon.redshift.util.RedshiftException: ERROR: current transaction is 
aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
An error report has been created at .../errorReportSql.txt
Run `rlang::last_trace()` to see where the error occurred.
```

A rollback is essentially like going back in time to a world before you ran the 
chunk of code that caused an error. You can easily do this using ohdsilab 
provided you've set the connection and schema default values above. 

```{r}
ohdsilab::rb()
```

This is synonymous with running.

```{r}
executeSql(con, "ROLLBACK;")
```

## Summary

If you're able to connect to the database and run a few basic queries - you 
should be good to go. Next, check out some of the other articles on this 
website. You might also want to browse Athena (https://athena.ohdsi.org/) to 
start thinking about how your area of interest is represented in OMOP. There are 
also lots of videos on using the OMOP CDM on youtube 
(https://www.youtube.com/@OHDSI).
