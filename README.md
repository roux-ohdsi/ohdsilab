### ohdsilab: Tools for using Roux OHDSI Lab at Northeastern University

<hr/>

The goals of the ohdsilab R package are two fold: 

1. Streamline working with the OHDSI-Lab database at the Roux Institute (and other OMOP CDM databases)

2. Provide an easier on-ramp for students and researchers new to working with the OMOP CDM or SQL 
databases. 

The package contains functions and template code snippets to facilitate easier use
of the OHDSI-Lab. These functions and snippets build on existing OHDSI R packages like
{DatabaseConnector} as well as standard R packages like {dplyr} and {tidyr}. The package also contains
a number of vingettes intended for R users who are new to OHDSI-Lab, the OMOP CDM, or working with 
data in SQL databases from R. 

If you're a new OHDSI-Lab user, after you've created your workspace and have successfully logged in, finish setting
up your R environment by [completing the setup tutorial](https://roux-ohdsi.github.io/ohdsilab/articles/01-intro-to-ohdsilab.html)

#### An important note on storage

Your OHDSI Lab Workspace is intended to be a resource for *compute*. ***It is NOT intended to be permanent storage***.
We do not recommend saving scripts permanently on your workspace without backing them up elsewhere.

The best practice is to use a version control system for saving code and results
to a location other than your workspace. We recommend using git and github for this purpose. 
Storage on your workspace should be considered temporary and not a location for long-term
storage. 

Thankfully, connecting git and github to R is now quite easy. Follow the steps in 
[Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat) chapter 9 to connect your
github account to RStudio. And while using git and github can be complex, for a single
user (you!), it's as simple as knowing these four commands: 

```
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "this is a message about the changes you made"
git push
```

Information about these commands can be found in [Happy Git with R](https://happygitwithr.com/git-commands) chapter 21. Or, for a visual explanation, see the [fantastic illustrations by Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com/git-github).
